# zacowan/web-mono

This is my monorepo for all personal, web-related projects going forward. Monorepos are great, since I can reuse my existing infrastructure (linting configs, ci/cd workflows, etc.) across multiple projects.

## Apps

- [personal-site](./apps/personal-site) - my current personal website, written in svelte with TypeScript

## Packages

- [eslint-config-zacowan](./packages/eslint-config-zacowan) - my personal linting configs
- [prettier-config](./packages/prettier-config) - my personal prettier configs
